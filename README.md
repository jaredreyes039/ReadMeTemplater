# ReadMeTemplater
Created By: Jay Reyes
---

## Description
- The ReadMeTemplater is a simple bash script that stems from my goal of improving efficiency and reducing production latency amongst fellow developers and myself. While simple, this script is easily expandable to fill your needs if necessary, though expect updates to include more details for future templates, as well as templating options. Anyhow, I hope you are able to find some use in this script as it ideally will minimize the bs of README file production while still targeting the necessary basics every README should have.

## Disclaimer
- Please, ensure the proper permissions are assigned to the downloaded script to execute it properly
