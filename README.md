## Description
- The ReadMeTemplater is a script designed to solve my grievance of inefficient markdown production. Often, as a fairly well-rounded developer, I find myself often needing to draft and/orpublish various README files to github. This script is fairly simple; the ReadMeTemplater, as the name suggests, templates a README.md file to use in your Github pages. Improving efficiency and productivity for others is my goal and obligation as a modern developer, so I hope you too can make use of this quick ReadMeTemplater tool to reduce latency in your source code deployment and production.
